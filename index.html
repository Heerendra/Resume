            <p><strong>Project Description</strong></p>
            <p>AOS (Airport Operating System) plays a crucial role in managing various operational aspects within airports, including stand allocation, desk allocation, gate management, and baggage handling.</p>
                <p><strong>Stand Allocation:</strong> AOS optimizes the allocation of aircraft stands, ensuring efficient use of available space and resources. It considers factors such as aircraft size, arrival/departure schedules, and maintenance requirements to allocate appropriate stands for parking and servicing aircraft.</p>                
                 <p><strong>Desk Allocation:</strong> AOS streamlines the allocation of check-in desks and counters based on passenger traffic, flight schedules, and airline requirements. It ensures that each airline has the necessary space and resources to manage passenger check-in processes smoothly.</p>                
                <p><strong>Gate Management:</strong> AOS facilitates effective gate management by coordinating the arrival and departure of flights at designated gates. It considers factors such as aircraft type, departure/arrival times, and boarding processes to optimize gate utilization and minimize delays.</p>                
                <p><strong>Baggage Handling:</strong> AOS plays a critical role in managing baggage handling processes, including baggage check-in, sorting, tracking, and loading onto aircraft. It ensures that baggage is efficiently transferred between terminals, flights, and connecting flights, minimizing the risk of mishandling and delays.</p>                
                <p>Overall, AOS enhances operational efficiency and passenger experience by optimizing resource allocation, streamlining processes, and minimizing disruptions in stand allocation, desk allocation, gate management, and baggage handling within airports.</p>
